Channel-Agenda
==============
The agenda and policy for #freecode on Rizon IRC.

Any non-trivial changes being proposed to this document should be voted on by the channel, and the changes either submitted as a pull request or as an issue, to be committed by a contributor with commit access.

TeX source is checked for changes every 15 minutes and auto-compiled and available from http://wat.strictfp.com/freecode.pdf.

TeX source should be formatted with each sentence on a new line; this makes comparing revisions easier.
